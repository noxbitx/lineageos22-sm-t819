# LineageOS 22 (Android 15) for Galaxy Tab S2 SM-T819 [UNOFFICIAL - WIP]

Welcome to the official development repository for the unofficial LineageOS 22 (Android 15) port for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 LTE – model SM-T819 (gts210veilte).

> **Status:** Work In Progress (Initial build + minimal patches)

## About
This project aims to bring Android 15 to the SM-T819, building upon the LineageOS 21 base and adapting existing configurations and kernel from the T813 Wi-Fi model, which shares near-identical hardware.

We're not starting from scratch—we're adapting, modifying, and optimizing.
